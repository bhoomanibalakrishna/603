## Summary
These two articles cover different aspects of Data Management and Storage.
### Article 1: NOSQL Databases
NoSQL Databse models are an alternative to our regular traditional Relational Database Systems. In the regular Relational Database there were limitaions such as horizontal scaling and handling unstructured data was a difficult task to accomplish, these difficulties led to the rise of NoSQL databases. NoSQL has various operational data models, that include key-value stores, columar databases, document-oriented databses, and graph databases. These models offer a number of benefits and are ideal for particular use situations. 
- **Key-value store Databases** : Efficiently stores associative arrays and are ideal for caching and session management. Such as Redis and Memcached.
- **Columnar Databases** : It excels in Data analytics and aggregations due to their column oriented storage. Such as Cassandra and Apache.
- **Document-oriented Databases** : These are mainly used in E-Commerce and content management as they can store data in documents with structure which makes them flexible to use for applications. Such as MongoDB and Couchbase.
- **Graph Databases** : These help to establish a relation between data points, which makes them very usefull for many applications such as recommendation engines and fraud detection.
### Conclusion
In conclusion this article provides us guidance on picking the right NoSQL informational index for a particular use case depending on your requirements as NoSQL offers diverse options in handling various problems and data types. 

### Article 2 : Data Lakehouse
A Data Lakehouse is a cutting-edge data management architecture that combines the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of Data Lakes with the data management capabilities and ACID transactions of Data Warehouse. This method enables the seamless integration of machine learning and business intelligence on all forms of data. Metadata layers like Delta Lake, high-performance SQL query engines for data lakes, and streamlined access for data science and machine learning tools are some of the key technologies supporting the data lakehouse. The data lakehouse is a viable solution for contemporary data-driven businesses because it tackles the drawbacks of conventional two-tier data structures by removing data duplication and improving data accessibility.
